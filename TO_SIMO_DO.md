# TO SIMO DO

## Post-Implementation Actions
- [ ] Verify that the GitHub Actions build now passes on the next push.
- [ ] Check the "Statistiche" page to ensure the charts still render correctly (I had to restore a `CartesianGrid` import).
- [ ] Check the "Nuova Prenotazione" dialog and "Tables" settings to ensure form fields (time, table, etc.) still update correctly after the refactor to `useWatch`.
